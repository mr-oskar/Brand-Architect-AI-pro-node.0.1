# Brand Architect AI Pro — Project Log

This file is the **single source of truth** for all work done on this project.

**Every agent session MUST:**
1. Read this file at the start of the session
2. Add a new `## Session [date]` entry at the **top** (newest first)
3. Mark items `[x]` when completed and `[ ]` for pending/planned
4. Never delete old entries — append only

## Session 2026-05-31 — Multi-select Model Picker

### Completed [x]

- [x] **`AdminApiKeys.tsx`** — `ModelPicker` converted from radio (single) to checkbox (multi-select). `FormState.textModels`/`imageModels` are now `string[]`. Auto-select on fetch fills first model. Summary row pills show all selected models. "N selected · primary: X" hint below each picker. Custom model IDs add to the list instead of replacing.
- [x] **`admin.py`** — `SetApiKeyRequest` extended with `textModels: list[str]` and `imageModels: list[str]` (alongside legacy `textModel`/`imageModel` for backward compat). `set_api_key` route passes new fields to `api_key_store.save()`.
- [x] **`api_key_store.py`** — Added `_coerce_to_list()` helper. `save()` now accepts `text_models`/`image_models` lists and stores both `textModels` (list) and `textModel` (first item, backward compat). `get_model_for_use_case()` reads list first, falls back to single string. New `get_models_for_use_case()` returns full list. `get_provider_list()` returns `textModels`/`imageModels` arrays alongside legacy single-model keys.

## Session 2026-05-30 — Enhanced Admin API Keys Panel

### Completed [x]

- [x] **`api_key_store.py`** — Added `PROVIDER_MODELS` dict with all models per provider (text + image categories + defaults). Updated `save()` to store `textModel` and `imageModel` preferences per provider. Added `get_model_for_use_case(use_case)`, `get_active_provider_id()`, `get_gemini_api_key()`. Updated `get_provider_list()` to return `textModel`, `imageModel`, `availableTextModels`, `availableImageModels` per provider.
- [x] **`client.py`** — Updated `resolve_model()` to check DB model preference first (via `get_model_for_use_case("text")`). Added `get_image_model()` which returns DB preference or falls back to hardcoded defaults. Updated `call_ai()` docstring to document model resolution order.
- [x] **`image.py`** — Fixed Gemini image key resolution: now uses `get_gemini_api_key()` (DB first, then env var) instead of only reading env var. All image generation functions use `get_image_model()` for dynamic model selection instead of hardcoded `"gpt-image-1"`.
- [x] **`admin.py`** — Added `textModel` and `imageModel` to `SetApiKeyRequest`. Added `GET /admin/api-keys/models` (predefined model lists). Added `POST /admin/api-keys/{provider}/fetch-models` (live model fetch from provider API). Updated `/test` endpoint to accept and use `textModel`. Updated `/api-keys/{provider}` POST to pass model prefs to `api_key_store.save()`.
- [x] **`AdminApiKeys.tsx`** — Full rewrite with 3-tab UI per provider (API Key / Text Model / Image Model). `ModelSelector` component with radio-button model list + custom model input. Model pills showing active text/image model on provider card. "Fetch available models" button for Nano Banana. Improved test result display (warning state). Enabled/disabled toggle in form.
- [x] **Windows scripts** — `scripts/setup.bat`, `scripts/dev.bat`, `scripts/stop.bat` for one-click Windows dev. Updated `.env.example` to document `EXTERNAL_DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Session 2026-05-30 — Local Dev Setup, Docs Overhaul, Cleanup (continued)

### Completed [x]

- [x] **Local development setup:**
  - `scripts/setup.sh` — First-time setup: checks Node.js 20+/pnpm/Python 3.11+, copies `.env.example`, installs JS + Python deps, creates DB tables. Safe to re-run.
  - `scripts/dev.sh` — Daily startup: loads `.env` from root, starts Python backend (port 8080, background) + React frontend (port 5000, foreground). Ctrl+C stops both cleanly.
  - `.env.example` — Full template with all required and optional env vars, commented.
- [x] **Docs complete rewrite:**
  - `DOCUMENTATION.md` — Full rewrite: local dev guide (step-by-step + Docker option + Windows note), Admin Panel → API Keys section, updated architecture/structure/API reference, cross-references to all guide files.
  - `BACKEND_GUIDE.md` — Full rewrite: `api_key_store.py` in folder map, new "How AI client resolution works" flowchart, new "Adding an AI provider key" pattern, updated admin routes, curl examples.
  - `FRONTEND_GUIDE.md` — Full rewrite: `AdminApiKeys.tsx` in folder map + routing table, fixed Option C to use `apiFetch` (was raw `fetch`), added admin-only page pattern, added State Management table.
  - `replit.md` — Updated "Where to make changes" table, backend/frontend key files sections, debugging tips, "Local development" quick-start, "Recent significant changes".
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — Added comprehensive 2026-05-30 entry covering all work.
- [x] **Cleanup:**
  - Removed root `main.py` (Replit placeholder — `print("Hello from repl-nix-workspace!")`)
  - Removed `lib/integrations/integrations-openai-ai-server/` (no imports found anywhere)
  - Added `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local` to `.gitignore` (were missing — security risk)
- [x] **Memory:** Created `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` + `api-key-store.md` topic file.

### Session 2026-05-30 — Admin API Key Management + Bug Fixes (earlier)

### Completed [x]

- [x] **Bug fix — `brands.py`:** `generate_brand_campaign` NameError (`charged` variable).
- [x] **Bug fix — `brand_kit.py`:** Silent AI fallback → now raises proper errors.
- [x] **Bug fix — `BrandKit.tsx`:** Raw `fetch()` → `apiFetch` (authenticated).
- [x] **New feature — Admin API Key Management:**
  - `app/utils/api_key_store.py` — 60s TTL DB cache + env var fallback
  - `app/services/ai/client.py` — reads from `api_key_store`, 60s client cache
  - `app/routes/admin.py` — 5 new routes (list/add/delete/toggle/test per provider)
  - `src/pages/AdminApiKeys.tsx` — full admin UI (add/edit/delete/test/toggle)
  - `App.tsx` + `Layout.tsx` — route + nav link registered

### Pending [ ]
- [ ] TypeScript typecheck may report pre-existing errors on `lib/api-client-react/dist/index.d.ts` — package exports from `src/` directly without a build step. Low priority.

## Session 2026-05-21 — Campaign Generation Overhaul

### Completed [x]
- [x] **Root cause analysis:** Identified 4 core problems with campaign generation:
  1. No trend research — comment "Add trend data injection" existed but was never implemented
  2. Only 5 of 15+ brand kit fields were passed to the AI (missing: dos/don'ts, audience segments, taglines, brand story, mission, vision, competitive position)
  3. `analyze_brief()` was only called when user wrote a brief — no analysis without brief
  4. No multi-phase pipeline — generation was a single prompt with no strategic research phase
- [x] **Rewrote `campaign.py`** with 3-phase multi-step pipeline:
  - **Phase 1 — `research_trends_and_opportunities()`** (always runs): AI researches current industry trends, audience pain points, campaign angles, proven hook techniques, trending hashtags, seasonal context, and recommends a campaign framework
  - **Phase 2 — `analyze_brief()`** (optional, when brief/images provided): analyzes client brief + vision-analyses reference images
  - **Phase 3 — `generate_campaign()`**: now receives full brand DNA block (all 15 brand kit fields including dos/don'ts, audience segments, taglines, brand story, mission, vision, competitive position) + trend research block + analyzed brief. Enforces 10 non-negotiable generation rules.
- [x] **Updated `brands.py`**: both `generate-campaign` and `campaign-brief-job` endpoints now call `research_trends_and_opportunities()` before generation. `campaign-brief-job` adds progress step labels for each phase.
- [x] **Added `step` field to `Job` dataclass** in `job_store.py` — pipeline now reports current step label ("Researching industry trends", "Analyzing campaign brief", etc.)
- [x] **Updated `/api/jobs/:id` route** in `system.py` to return `step` field so frontend can display current progress label
- [x] Updated `campaign-brief-job` total steps from 6 → 7 to match new pipeline

### Pending [ ]
- [ ] Frontend: use `step` field in job progress UI for better UX feedback

## Session 2026-05-21 — Refactoring & Agent Rules

### Completed [x]
- [x] Migrated project from Replit Agent to Replit environment
- [x] Installed Python deps via `uv sync`, Node deps via `pnpm install`
- [x] Fixed DB model type mismatch: `brands.user_id` changed from `Text` → `PG_UUID`
- [x] Created all DB tables via `Base.metadata.create_all()`
- [x] Configured AI integration (Replit OpenAI proxy) for Python backend
- [x] Added strong "NEVER BREAK EXISTING FEATURES" rules to `replit.md`
- [x] Created `PROJECT_LOG.md` (this file) for session tracking
- [x] Created `src/lib/imageUtils.ts` — extracted `removeLogoBackground`, `resizeImageFile`, `fileToDataUrl` from `CampaignWorkspace.tsx` and `BrandWizard.tsx`
- [x] Created `src/lib/apiFetch.ts` — centralized authenticated fetch wrapper (replaces scattered `authHeaders()` + raw `fetch` calls)
- [x] Added new shared types to `src/types/index.ts`: `ImageSize`, `ImageGenOptions`, `PostImageHistoryEntry`, `ReferenceImageItem`, `PostVariant`, `LongFormContent`
- [x] Added new shared constants to `src/lib/constants.ts`: `PLATFORM_CONFIG`, `IMAGE_SIZE_OPTIONS`, `IMAGE_MODEL_OPTIONS`, `IMAGE_ASPECT_PRESETS`, `POST_STATUS_BADGE`
- [x] Extracted `ImageGenDialog` from `CampaignWorkspace.tsx` → `src/components/ImageGenDialog.tsx`
- [x] Extracted `PostPreviewDialog` from `CampaignWorkspace.tsx` → `src/components/PostPreviewDialog.tsx`
- [x] Extracted `PostCard` + field sub-components from `CampaignWorkspace.tsx` → `src/components/PostCard.tsx`
- [x] Updated `CampaignWorkspace.tsx`: reduced from 1885 → ~400 lines (page orchestration only)
- [x] Updated `BrandWizard.tsx`: replaced inline image processing with `resizeImageFile` from `imageUtils`
- [x] Fixed security issue: moved scattered `authHeaders()` to centralized `apiFetch.ts`

### Known Issues / Pending [ ]
- [ ] `job_store.py` uses in-memory storage — jobs are lost on server restart. Migrate to DB or Redis.
- [ ] `threading.Thread` in `posts.py` for bulk image gen doesn't scale across instances. Migrate to task queue (Celery/RQ) when needed.
- [ ] `CampaignBriefPage.tsx` has hardcoded platform data — should use `PLATFORM_CONFIG` from constants
- [ ] Auth token sent in both cookie and Authorization header — consolidate to one approach
- [ ] `BrandKit.tsx` PDF generation mixes inline styles with Tailwind — needs cleanup
- [ ] No `meta` tags or Open Graph — add in `index.html` for social sharing previews
- [ ] `PostCard` inside `PostCard.tsx` is still ~450 lines — consider extracting individual panel components (VariantPanel, LongFormPanel) in a future session

---

### Completed [x]
- [x] Added `app/middleware/` folder — `RequestLoggerMiddleware` extracted from `main.py`
- [x] Added `app/utils/` folder — `pagination.py`, `ownership.py`, `ai_errors.py`
- [x] Added `src/types/index.ts` — shared TypeScript types
- [x] Added `src/lib/constants.ts` — app-wide constants
- [x] Added `src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`, `useLocalStorage.ts`, `useJobPoller.ts`
- [x] Credits system rewritten with full transaction logging
